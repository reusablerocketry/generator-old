[Grid fins](wikipedia) (also known as lattice fins) are used
to stabilize a vehicle, much like the more commonly used planar
fins. Grid fins have several advantages over planar fins:

1. They can be folded compactly against the vehicle, which is
   necessary during the ascent.
2. They perform much better than planar fins while subsonic and
   supersonic. However, in the transsonic region, they produce very
   high amounts of drag.
3. They are lighter and more compact than an equivalent planar fin.

They are used on the [SpaceX](term) [Falcon 9](term)
[booster stage](term) to provide aerodynamic control of the vehicle
during its [reentry](term) and [landing](term:propulsive landing).
