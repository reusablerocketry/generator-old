It's a common question, and one that has some merit: why doesn't
SpaceX just use parachutes to recover the Falcon 9 booster?

SpaceX's eventual goal is booster reuse within 24 hours of a
launch. This means that the booster can't spend two days being
transported back to the launch site (which is approximately how long
it takes for a boat to traverse the distance from an ocean dropsite to
land). Instead, they have to land on land. This requires that SpaceX
perform what they call a boostback burn; this maneuver reverses the
trajectory of the booster back towards the launch site. At this point,
SpaceX _could_ use parachutes, but then you encounter the other two
problems:

1. Reentry into the Earth's atmosphere is hot and deadly.
2. Salt water (or any type of water) wreaks havoc with the delicate
engines and systems of the rocket.

Reentry is very, very hot. The booster must withstand slamming into
the dense atmosphere while traveling at supersonic speeds,
engine-first. The Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters were effectively
giant steel tubes; the Falcon 9 booster is delicate and relatively
weak. Unlike the Shuttle SRBs, the Falcon 9 would probably burn up
during an uncontrolled reentry. So SpaceX has to perform an entry burn
to slow down the vehicle as it begins to enter the atmosphere. (The
three-engine burn also has the side effect of keeping the other six
engines relatively clean from airborne contaminants). Once those two
burns have been completed, the vehicle is now falling at nearly
Mach 1.

Here is where a parachute could be used. But there's a problem -- the
booster can't splash into the ocean. The salt water and the impact
would ruin the booster and the expensive engines. At this point,
you're next to land anyway, the engines are there anyway, you might as
well just land propulsively.
