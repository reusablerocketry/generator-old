The upgraded Falcon 9 launch vehicle lifted off from SpaceX's LC-40 at
Cape Canaveral at 20:19 local time on December 21, 2015 and flawlessly
completed its mission. The eleven Orbcomm Generation 2
machine-to-machine satellites were deployed at about T+12 minutes, and
the booster performed a propulsive landing at Landing Zone 1 at about
T+9:45. After deploying the satellites, the Falcon 9 second stage
performed a second deorbit burn, crucial for the upcoming SES-9
mission.
